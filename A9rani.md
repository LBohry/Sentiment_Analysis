# Sentiment_Analysis Read Me : 
There are 2 webscraping files : 
  The first one is a simplistic one on a particular movie with minimal information but it works
  The second one is a detailed one on 100 movies with decent information but it has bugs 
  I used a minimal information kaggle imdb dataset as a development set to compare the different models 
  I used the first web scrapped movie as a test example at the end of the notebook
